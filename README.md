Ricardo Rivera Project Portfolio

Here in this Repository, you can find various practice and real world projects I have worked on, focusing on refining my ability to manipulate and visualize data to provide meaningful insights.

1. DataCleaningTidyVerse
   This database is public for all to use, and I wanted to practice basic data cleaning techniques to build good work patterns.
   Additionally, I wanted to understand that clean data will almost never exist, therefore it is always an essential step before moving forward with '
   
2. In_Process_Quality_Control_Record
  This excel file is one I created for the purpose of keeping track with manufacturing floor technician findings.
  Here, I used VBA tools to ensure that can choose only of the options listed, keeping the data consistent when a finding wa input, along with a calculated data sheet to keep track of top monthly, quarterly, and yearly findings

3. ProcessTimeV1
   After seeing that our production numbers were not going up, even after other improvements were set in place, I decided to find the tme each process takes throughout the lines
   I extracted a day's worth of data from our MES system and utilized python to calculate the difference between the times shown, cleaning up the columns as needed
   This helped identify areas for improvment to target across all teams in the manufacturing facility, with an increase of 8% production rate so far
   
4. SQLQueryCovid
   Project follow along, where I worked with a Covid database provided at the website https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths
   The goal of working through this database was to get a higher level understanding than just the basics on how a real world database can be explored.
   Using Microsoft SQL Server Management studio, I performed a variety of different data manipulation techniques to see how it would change the data.
   After getting a better understanding and identifying the areas that needed cleaning, I was able to filter to find specific information that would be later used visually in Tableau
   
6. fifa21
   This dataset was found on kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yagunnersya/fifa-21-messy-raw-dataset-for-cleaning-exploring/data
   Here, my goal was to practice a few techniques I have not used in a while, making sure I still remember how to go from a messy dataset, to one that we can work with later down the line.
   I used numpy and pandas in Python to convert columns into their correct value, and clean whatever else is necessary by observing unique values in the data

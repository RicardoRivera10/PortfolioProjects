1. DataCleaningTidyVerse
   This database is public for all to use, and I wanted to practice basic data cleaning techniques to build good work patterns.
   Additionally, I wanted to understand that clean data will almost never exist, therefore it is always an essential step before moving forward with '
   
2. In_Process_Quality_Control_Record
  This excel file is one I created for the purpose of keeping track with manufacturing floor technician findings.
  Here, I used VBA tools to ensure that can choose only of the options listed, keeping the data consistent when a finding wa input, along with a calculated data sheet to keep track of top monthly, quarterly, and yearly findings

3. ProcessTimeV1
   After seeing that our production numbers were not going up, even after other improvements were set in place, I decided to find the tme each process takes throughout the lines
   I extracted a day's worth of data from our MES system and utilized python to calculate the difference between the times shown, cleaning up the columns as needed
   This helped identify areas for improvment to target across all teams in the manufacturing facility, with an increase of 8% production rate so far

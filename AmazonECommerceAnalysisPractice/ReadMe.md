Here are the files where I practice more of the data analysis workflow. The dataset can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/unlock-profits-with-e-commerce-sales-data
I took the updated file after it was edited in the python file found in the folder, and used it to create the visualization you see below. <br>
Here, I wanted to highlight the sales, orders, and demogrpahics that can be used to identify possible area for improvement.
Using this data, I can see that western dresses were bought more, while the top two products have been slowly declining.
Perhaps this lets us know of certain trends in they way people dress, leading to more sales in the western style dresses.

This file contains a practice dataset where I learn how to use slicer values to compare prior years data to the current year.
This can be very useful, especially when looking at a company's data to help them determine the best areas of proditability!
Additionally, I practiced using different visuals in PowerBI that strangthened one's ability to find trends and isolate areas for improvement.
I broke the data down further in the Model view after creating dimensions based on the dates I wanted to search between.
Visuals utilized include scatter chart, line/stacked column chart, slicers, waterfall cahrt, and treemap.
